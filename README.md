# Flower_Recognition
What kind of flower is that?

# Description
The goal of the project is to identify flowers belonging to five classes: daisy, tulip, rose, sunflower, dandelion. 
The dataset is available for download at https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition.
I have built a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) using tensorflow and keras to classify the flowers.
